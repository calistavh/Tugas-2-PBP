A man who's anxious about his upcoming arranged marriage accidentally proposes to a corpse while reciting his vows. The story is straightforward and ends happily, contrasting the dark setting of the entire movie. A great combination for me."

It tells a story of how an ex-soldier, now a scribe named Violet reunites with the major she loves after years of his speculated death. It's slow-paced and somewhat less intensive than the series, but the heartwarming end that wraps her tragic past is worth the time."

It's about nine small stitchpunk dolls named in numbers surviving against AI-equipped war machines in a world rid of living things. Watching it again after I grew up made me notice some plot inconsistencies, but the dark setting always awes me."

She's such a relatable character for audiences of similar age dealing with internal conflict. The fantasy setting near the end isn't to my liking, but it's a charming movie overall."
